Euphemism Detection in Text Dataset
Overview:
This project identifies euphemisms in text data using NLP techniques and allows manual updates to refine the dataset. Euphemisms are detected by analyzing synonyms from WordNet, and the script provides an interactive interface for user input and dataset enhancement.

Features:
Euphemism Detection:

Identifies words with multiple synonyms using WordNet's lexical database.
CSV Dataset Handling:

Reads a text dataset from a CSV file.
Detects euphemisms in sentences and logs the results.
Interactive Manual Updates:

Prompts users to validate or correct detected euphemisms.
Updates the dataset with user-provided corrections.
Dataset Export:

Saves the updated dataset to a new CSV file (updated_dataset.csv).
Dependencies:
Libraries:
nltk: Tokenization and synonym analysis with WordNet.
pandas: Reading and updating the dataset in CSV format.
Prerequisites:
Install the required libraries:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas nltk
Download necessary NLTK resources:
python
Copy
Edit
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')
How to Use:
Replace your_file.csv with the path to your dataset.
Run the script, which will:
Tokenize text and detect euphemisms in the sentence column.
Prompt you to manually review and correct detected euphemisms.
Save the updated dataset automatically after processing.
